<h1>I'm Vulpe, nice to meet you!</h1>

<h2>Let me tell you a little about me:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I have a scalable architectural model, I use design patterns
	which makes my relationship with other frameworks easier;</li>
	<li>I have a low coupling between my layers;</li>
	<li>My distribution of services is made transparently to the
	developer;</li>
	<li>My persistence layer is decoupled from other layers and
	technologies;</li>
	<li>I have native support for db4o database object-oriented, so
	build applications with me is much easier and faster, because the data
	model are their own entities;</li>
	<li>I use the controls AJAX in a standardized manner;</li>

	use full capabilities of the JEE specification, such as EJB, JMS, JNDI,
	JPA, JTA, JTS, SOAP;</li>
	<li>I become very easy to clustering and distribution services;</li>
	<li>I can generate all the code between the complex layers
	including the presentation (view), so I am very productive;</li>

	</li>
	<li>With me it's easy to do:
	<ul>
		<li>Maintenance</li>
		<li>Use cases</li>
		<li>Mechanisms</li>
		<li>and Training</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
